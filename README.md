# <b>SQL</b>

### SQL for Beginners with all topics covered in one workbench

I used MySQL for the whole topics to be covered here. 

Why?

I think its the best option available there if you are starting your journey in SQL. Its Free. All features are available in free m=version as well.
You don't need to find out any key and all.

I am attaching the link to the PDF by referring which you can install al application easily.
